# ShopSphere Backend

## Overview

ShopSphere Backend is a microservices-based backend application for an e-commerce platform. It handles core functionalities such as user management, product catalog, orders, payments, and more.

This project is containerized using Docker, and a `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to run all services together.

## Database Setup

MySQL is not dockerized in this setup. You have two options:

1. **Use a MySQL container:**
```

Update docker-compose.yml to include a MySQL service.
Configure other services to connect to this container.

```

2. **Use MySQL on host machine:**
```

Create necessary databases and users on your host MySQL server based on each microservice's entity class.
Update service configurations to connect to the host database.

````

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
````

3. Verify services are running and accessible via their exposed ports.
